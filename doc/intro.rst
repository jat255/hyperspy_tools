Introduction
============
This module is used to perform some various tasks that are useful to me when
using `HyperSpy`_, but probably not general enough for inclusion in the primary
codebase. The package is currently split into two modules:
:py:mod:`~hyperspy_tools.plotting`, which provides some useful extra plotting
configuration, and :py:mod:`~hyperspy_tools.shifting_lines`, which contains
code that can be used to align an area scan (or line scans) across a planar
interface that appear to jump around due to spatial drift in the TEM.
